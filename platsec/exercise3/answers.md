# Run-time Security

## 1.

### a.

Generally, we should assume that it is insecure to run. While certain compilers may treat this specific scenario in a way that the UB is handled such that it is not vulnerable, others may compile it such that exploitation is possible.

### b.

This depends on the scenario. If we know that our program is compiled and used such that the implementation defined-behavior does not introduce any vulnerabilty, this may be a viable approach to e.g., optimize an application. Although, generally speaking, the risk that another developer misuses the source code in a way that was not originally intended and not accounted for when leveraging implementation-defined behavior is high, it is clear that it should be avoided at all times.

### c.

Dullien states that

> Now we consider an attacker that has the ability to somehow move the cpu into a weird stateâ€”a state that has no

Therefore, it becomes apparent that such a proof is impossible since the weird-machine exhibits behavior which is not intended of the IFSM.

### c.

#### i.

The attack does not work any longer since we do not know the virtual address of the target function since it gets randomized epheremaly.

#### ii.

The attacker needs a leak of the current address randomization, which he can then use to calculate the position of the target executable. Since the offsets inside the .text section are constant even with ASLR enabled, the leak can be any address (variable, function ...) with a constant offset to the target function.
