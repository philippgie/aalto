## Description of the problem

The `frontdoor` challenge requires to exploit an application to obtain a flag.
The application reqeusts a credentials.

## Solution

Upon decompilation with jadx I saw that the app contains debug code with show the usage of debug credentials. First, I attempted to patch  the given apk by flipping the value of debug which was initially set to false, and inserting a logging statement at the end. However, while I was able to run the application in the submission system after signing it did not work. Decompilication with jadx showed the desired code but no luck anyhow. 
Before spending more time with this approach I diverted to writing an app which just connects to the given address, which is the loopback of the emulator host. I reused the code from the reacingout challenge and was able to obtain the flag.
