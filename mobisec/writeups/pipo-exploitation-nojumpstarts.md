# Solution

## Description of the problem

The `nojumpstarts` challenge requires to exploit an application to obtain a flag.
The application uses signatures to communicate between activities via intents. The signatures are used to authenticate the message. Together, the activites form a chain Main->A->B->C.

## Solution

Upon decompilation with jadx I saw that the app uses a hardcoded private key. I began writing an application that sends an intent to nojumpstarts.A, which I then assumed would forward the chain to b and then to C, from where then the flag would backpropagate to me. Hwoever, for unknown reasons to me this did not work. Hence, I instead directly sent an intent to C, copying the methods from the decompiled code and setting Main-to-A/A-to-B as the message. Now, C replied with the flag.
