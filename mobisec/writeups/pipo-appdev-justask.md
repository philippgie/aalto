The helloworld challenge requires to develop an app that prints a specific
string with a specific verbosity and tag using Android's Logging API.

## Solution

> Here describe how you solved the challenge
> NOTE If you partially solved the challenge describe what you did anyway

I've solved the challenge by developing an app doing X and Y. My app uses
permissions PX because of FOO. I'm also using the BAR API to do BAZ.

I really liked this challenge because of FOO and BAR.

I think you can improve the challenge by doing X and Z.

This challenge sucks  because of FOO and BAR.
